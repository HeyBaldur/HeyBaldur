# Hey, I'm Baldur

I’m a developer who loves building things that bring people together.  
Most of us start projects full of energy… then end up stuck, alone, and overthinking.  
That’s why I built **[GoConnect.dev](https://goconnect.dev)** — a place where devs, founders, and makers can find their circle and finally **launch together**.

> Stop building alone. Find your circle. Launch together. 🚀

### What’s GoConnect?
GoConnect helps solo devs and small teams move from idea to launch with structure and accountability.  
Each **Circle** is limited to 5 people, just enough for real trust and focus.  

You’ll get:
- 💬 Real-time chat and audio rooms  
- 📅 Weekly follow-ups and check-ins  
- 📘 Shared wikis for progress tracking  
- 🔒 Private, distraction-free spaces  

No spam. No lurkers. Just people actually building things.

### What I’m working on
Right now, I’m focused on:
- Making Circle matching smarter and more personal  
- Adding AI-powered summaries and project insights  
- Building better integrations with GitHub and Notion
